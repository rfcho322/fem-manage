### How I developed it?

This was created using **HTML**, **CSS Grid**, a bit of **JavaScript** for the hamburger menu and **A11y slider** for product comments, tools like **Vite** for bundling and for rapid frontend development.

### Built using
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM (“Block”, “Element”, “Modifier”)
- JavaScript

### Resources

- Vite: https://vitejs.dev/
- A11y Slider Library: https://a11yslider.js.org/ - works by using CSS scroll snapping. You can generate a slider by creating an overflowed container and then setting widths all via CSS. Media queries in your CSS will also update the slider.
